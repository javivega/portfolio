                    <p>Golfers spend 4 hours average in their games, and the most of the time, they are not actually playing, but talking or walking. People they play with and other factors seem very relevant at the moment of taking the decision whether play or not.</p>

                    <p>This process became tedious, as the information is delocalised and sometimes, such as the condition of the course, was only accessible by asking the club directly by phone.</p>
